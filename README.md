One of the most exciting aspects of this role is applying my IT skills to create a tool that merges technology and education. The project has also allowed me to develop valuable leadership skills, manage timelines, and collaborate effectively with my team to deliver meaningful outcomes. This hands-on experience has not only deepened my knowledge of software engineering but has also provided me with the chance to lead a project that has a direct impact on enhancing language learning.
