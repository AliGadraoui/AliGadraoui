<h2> 💡 Soft Skills :</h2>

<h3>-💬 [Communication]:</h3>Communication is a cornerstone of my professional and academic pursuits. In 2018, I honed this essential skill by attending a seminar on Process Communication Model®, which culminated in my certification. This experience equipped me with the tools to navigate diverse communication styles effectively, ensuring that I can connect with individuals from all walks of life and collaborate efficiently. I pride myself on my ability to clearly articulate ideas, actively listen, and foster an environment where every voice is valued.

My leadership journey didn't stop at the pitch; for five years, I served as the delegate of my school class, a testament to my peers' trust in me to represent our collective interests and serve as a liaison between students and faculty. These experiences have shaped me into a leader who inspires, motivates, and strives for collective success.
